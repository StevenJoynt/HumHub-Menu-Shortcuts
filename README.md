# HumHub-Menu-Shortcuts

## What does it do?

This is a HumHub module to add quick access shortcut keys (aka [access keys](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_accesskey.asp)) to the Space Menu.

This will allow an item from the Space Menu to be quickly activated by hitting a special key sequence depending on the web browser. 

This can be useful when the menu scrolls off the visiable page due to a long stream or large Wiki page etc.

## How do I install it?

1. Download the module from [GitHub](https://github.com/StevenJoynt/HumHub-Menu-Shortcuts)
2. Install this module in a folder called `protected/humhub/modules/shortcuts` within your HumHub web site.
3. Sign in to your HumHub as an administrator, and enable the module.

At this point, the module is ready for use, but doesn't do anything! It needs to be enabled and configured within individual HumHub Spaces. Read the next section...
